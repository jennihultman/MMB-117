## Working with your own data

Sequences have arrived and they can be found from `/wrk/hultman/shared/MMB117_SEQS` FIX THIS

Do you want to analyze your own samples or all of them to compare your samples to others? Are for example the acricultural sites similar or different?

Get the sequence from that folder and the negative controls. The `BI-PCR-0-ctrl`samples are water controls for the barcoding PCR, take them as well.
